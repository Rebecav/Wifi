    At HotSpotNYC our aim is to provide a method for obtaining free WiFi by connecting people to New York City Link kiosks.
    <br>
    We used two different APIs to make this website.
    The first one was NYC OpenData, which we used to find out the locations of the Link Kiosks in New York. The second was OpenLayers, which allowed us to have a map accessible on our Home Page.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    We have worked on this project for about seven days and we have successfully developed the basis and foundations but still have much to work and improve upon. In the future, we plan to expand on this project in that we hope to work enhance the map and incorporate pins for specific locations.
    We also hope to refine the search bar and augment the overall website as a whole.
