  <title>HotSpotNYC</title>

<p>
As HotSpotNYC we hope to connect people to New York City Link Kiosks.
</p>
<p>
We used two different APIs to make this website.
The first one was NYC OpenData, which we used to find out the locations of the Link Kiosks in New York. The second was OpenLayers, which allowed us to have a map accessible on our Home Page.
</p>
<p>
We have worked on this project for about seven days and if we were to expand on this project in the future we would hope to work on the map and add pins.
We would also work on the search bar and overall improve upon the OpenLayer map.
